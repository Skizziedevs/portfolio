          On February of 2021, I and many others were laid off as part of a
          reduction of force measure at Cognizant Softvision. It was a gut punch
          and one of the most difficult experience I have ever gone through.

          After a few weeks of self-reflection, I was determined to make the
          best I could out of the situation.

          I always found ecommerce extremely fascinating. The buzz of making
          balancing the needs of customer, ensuring constant supplies, and
          working within a platform. I saw that there was a huge need by the
          public for access to cheap and affordable personal protective
          equipment. I decided to jump into eBay as a full time seller of
          affordable PPE.

          Over just the course of five months I sold $35,000 worth of PPE to
          consumers world wide. But for me, it was never about the money. It was
          always about learning about how ecommerce worked and helping my local
          community. I ended up donating around $20,000 worth of goods to local
          first responders and hospitals. The image above is a picture from
          nurses I donated some masks to.

            Customer satisfaction is difficult to maintain but extremely
            rewarding. It feels great to go out of my way to ensure that a
            customer is happy with their purchase. Even if I have to issue
            refunds or take a hit on inventor

            Procuring supplies, especially personal protective equipment,
            requires a significant amount of understanding laws and regulations

            Always monitor the costs of business. Ecommerce platform fees
            quickly add up
